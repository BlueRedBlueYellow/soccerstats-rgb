# soccerstats-rgb
Made in Python. Displays soccer stats for a match in the form of a fancy bar, (using [OpenRGB](https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB))! Works for any team that has an ongoing match/the last match a team has played. Uses Google to search.

Feel free to contribute or open up an issue if it doesn't work for your keyboard, for it seriously helps!

# HOW TO USE
- [OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org/) is required, you can download it there. 
- Click SDK Server and click "Start Server" in OpenRGB. This allows the software to connect to your keyboard. May not work for keyboards that don't have direct mode.
- Download the latest release and boot up the EXE.

## Not working! Help!

- If you have multiple keyboards (or keyboard-like devices) connected, you may need to specify the keyboard or device you want to use RGB on. Edit the number of "-keyboard_number-" in the JSON to match your listed device.
- Is the match avaliable on Google in its own box, like [this](https://i.imgur.com/WFO2Fqi.png)? 
- Try adding the folder the EXE is in to your [PATH](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44272416/how-to-add-a-folder-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-10-with-screensho), though it shouldn't need this since it directly links to the scrapers.

Hopefully you enjoy!
