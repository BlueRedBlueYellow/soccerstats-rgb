# soccerstats-rgb
Scrapes soccer stats with Selenium to display on RGB keyboards (using [OpenRGB](https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB)).

Since I only have a GMMK keyboard with [OpenRGB/VIA firmware](https://github.com/gloryhzw/qmk_tool/wiki/VIA-OpenRGB-for-GMMK), I currently can't test this on other keyboards. Feel free to contribute or open up an issue if it doesn't work for yours!

# TO DO LIST
- Build and release as an .EXE for ease
- Add more themes when a secondary color is used (currently just stripes)
- Maybe add animations for when a goal is scored?
- Clean up requirements.txt
